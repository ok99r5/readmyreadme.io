## 2012

We listen to the immortal music of Mozart's Adagio of the Clarinet Concerto in A.

Space, infinite and empty. But then, slowly all nine planets of our Solar System move into frame and align.

The last of them is the giant, burning sphere of the sun.

Just as the sun enters frame, a solar storm of gigantic proportion unfolds. The eruptions shoot thousands of miles into the blackness of space.

Mozart's concerto filters from a jeep's stereo, fighting the drumming sounds of the monsoon rain. PROF. FREDERIC WEST, 66, listens to the music.

An Indian BOY playing by the roadside steers his wooden toy ship across a puddle.

The Professor turns to his driver, pointing to the boy.

PROF. WEST: Watch out!

But it's too late. The jeep drives straight through the puddle at full speed, sinking the boy's toy ship.

In the background, the jeep stops in front of a building. The driver jumps out, leading the Professor towards its entrance.

The sign at the door reads: Institute for Astrophysics - University of New Delhi.
